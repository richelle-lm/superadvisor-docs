# KYC Updates

## Overview

The **KYC (Know Your Client) Updates** module is an essential compliance tool for tracking, managing, and auditing client reviews across your entire business portfolio. Accessible via Client Service > KYC Updates in the side navigation, this centralized dashboard ensures your firm maintains current client information in line with regulatory standards.

This module acts as the compliance "Command Center," enabling you to initiate and monitor reviews, while detailed data entry is conducted within specific Household records.

### The KYC Updates Dashboard
