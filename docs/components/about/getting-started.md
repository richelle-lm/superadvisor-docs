# Getting Started

To help you hit the ground running, follow these essential first steps to configure your account and start managing your practice effectively.

### 1. Log In & Dashboard Orientation 

Access the platform via your unique login URL. Upon signing in, you will land on the **Home Dashboard**. Treat this as your daily launchpad; it displays key business metrics at the top, followed by your daily agenda, task list, and pipeline summary.

### 2. Set Up Your Profile 
Navigate to your **Profile Settings**. Ensure your personal details, and contact information are correct. This step is critical to ensure that your meeting scheduler and calendar syncs function accurately.

### 3. Connect Email & Calendar 
Navigate to the **Emails** module and select **View Email Accounts**. Follow the prompts to connect your professional account (Gmail or Outlook). This integration syncs your communications and enables the platform to automatically track client interactions.

### 4. Add Your First Contacts 
Head to the **Contacts** module. You can add a new contact manually to familiarize yourself with the data fields, or look for import options to bulk upload your existing client list.

:::note TIP
When you add a Contact, the system effectively auto-creates a Household record to link them to. Check the **Households** module to see this connection in action.

### 5. Explore the Modules 
Click through the main sidebar navigation to visit **Households**, **Opportunities**, **Tasks**, and **Meetings**. Understanding how these modules interconnect (e.g., a Task linked to a Contact, which belongs to a Household) is key to mastering the platform.
