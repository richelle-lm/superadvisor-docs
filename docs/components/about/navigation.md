# Navigating SuperAdvisor

## Overview 

Mastering the **SuperAdvisor** interface is essential for efficiency. The platform is designed with a hierarchy that allows you to manage broad practice operations while quickly drilling down into specific client details. 

This guide covers the three pillars of platform navigation:
* [**Sidebar Menu:**](#sidebar-menu) Your primary tool for accessing modules and navigating to deep management pages.
* [**Global Search:**](#global-search) A feature enabling the instant retrieval of records, such as clients or notes, from anywhere in the platform.

## Sidebar Menu

**Overview** 

The **Sidebar Menu** is your primary navigation rail, located on the left-hand side of the screen. It organizes the platform’s modules into logical workflows, moving from client relationships to daily operations and practice settings.
