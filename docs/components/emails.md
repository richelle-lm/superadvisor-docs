# Emails
## Overview

The **Emails** module serves as your integrated communication hub, allowing you to compose, send, and track messages directly from the platform. It functions similarly to other email applications but is designed to keep your client correspondence centralized and actionable within your SuperAdvisor workflow.

This module provides a unified view of your team's communication, enabling you to filter inboxes by specific team members, track the status of messages (Drafts, Scheduled, Sent), and maintain a clear history of client interactions without switching between different email providers.

## Dashboard Views

The main interface is organized to help you manage your inbox and outgoing messages efficiently:

* **Status Tabs:**
    * **To Do:** Emails requiring action or follow-up.
    * **Drafts:** Messages started but not yet sent.
    * **Scheduled:** Emails queued for future delivery.
    * **Complete:** Sent and archived messages.
* **History Views:** Switch between viewing your complete email history or just recent communications.

## Email Signatures

Email signatures ensure consistent, professional branding across your team's communications. The Email Signatures section allows you to create, manage, and assign custom signatures for different advisors or use cases.
