# Households

## Overview

**Households** function as "Containers" for managing family units, allowing you to aggregate individual contacts (such as spouses and children) and legal entities (like corporations and trusts) into a single record. This structure provides a unified "Total Wealth" view, which is essential for comprehensive financial planning where assets and liabilities are often shared across the family rather than held in isolation.

This module is deeply integrated with other key functions to streamline operations. For example, **Billing** is managed at the household level, enabling you to invoice the primary account holder for the combined assets of the entire family. Similarly, **Service Models** are assigned to the household, ensuring that service tiers (e.g., "Gold Client") are consistently applied to all family members for a uniform client experience.
