# Financial Records

The **Financial Records** module serves as the central repository for a client's entire financial life. From a project management perspective, this is your "source of truth" database. It is designed to consolidate fragmented financial data—ranging from liquid cash and public securities to complex private equity and liabilities—into a unified, real-time structure.

In holistic wealth management, data integrity is paramount. By linking every asset and liability to a specific Household, this module drives the calculation of Net Worth statements and informs strategic advice. It eliminates data silos, allowing you to see how a decision in one area (e.g., taking out a Line of Credit) impacts the overall financial picture (e.g., Net Worth and Cash Flow).



The **Financial Records** module is organized into specific sub-pages to categorize different types of financial instruments:

* [**Banking & Investment Assets:**](banking-investment) Manage liquid assets including **Bank Accounts** and **Investment Accounts**.
* [**Credit & Liabilities:**](credit-liabilities) Track debts including **Loans**, **Credit Cards**, and **Lines of Credit**.
* [**Property & Alternative Assets:**](property-assets) Manage illiquid holdings including **Real Estate**, **Real Assets**, **Private Investments**, and **Company Equity**.
* [**Insurance & Income Planning:**](insurance-income) Manage risk and cash flow via **Insurance Policies**, **Defined Benefit Pensions**, and **Cash Flows**.
