# Scheduling Meetings

There are different ways to initiate a meeting from the dashboard, depending on how the time is selected.

## How to Request a Meeting

You can schedule meetings with prospects and clients directly from the dashboard. (client selects time)

1. Click the **Request Meeting** button located at the top of the dashboard.
2. In the **Request a Meeting** pop-up, select the *Assignee*:
     * **Who is the organizer of the meeting?:** Select from the **Team Members** who will be hosting the meeting.
     * **Which clients or team members are you inviting?:**  Select from **Team Members** or **Contacts** you wish to include in the meeting.
3. Choose a **Template** to automatically populate the **Event Information**, **Agenda**, and **Tasks**. You can also leave this blank to set everything up manually.
4. Select a pre-defined **Schedule Template** or create a custom one. This will automatically fill in the availability rules in the **Scheduling Info** section.
5. If a template was selected, review the pre-filled **Event Information** (*Title, Duration, Timezone, Meeting Type, and Message*). If no template was used, fill these details out manually.
6. If a template was selected, review the pre-filled **Meeting Agenda**. If no template was used, add specific discussion points manually.
7. If a template was selected, review the pre-filled Pre-meeting and Post-meeting **Tasks**. If no template was used, add specific tasks manually to ensure preparation and follow-up work is tracked.
8. Configure the **Scheduling Info** to define the rules for this specific booking:
    * **Available Hours:** Set the specific days and times the host is free.
    * **Buffers:** Add padding time before and after the slot to prevent back-to-back meetings.
    * **Minimum Notice:** Define how far in advance a meeting must be booked (e.g., 2 Days).
    * **Cancellation Notice:** Set the minimum time required to cancel without penalty (e.g., 24 Hours).

:::note NOTE
You will be returned to the **Meeting list** view; search for the meeting name you recently added to view the details.
