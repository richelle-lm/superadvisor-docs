# Meetings
## Overview

The **Meetings** module serves as your central command center for all scheduling logistics. It integrates calendar availability with custom meeting templates to create seamless booking experiences, eliminating the "email ping-pong" of finding a suitable time.

Use this module to allow clients to self-book based on real-time availability, automate logistics like Zoom links and agendas, and integrate scheduling steps directly into your automated Workflows.

This section covers four key areas:

* [**The Meetings Dashboard:**](meetings-list.md) Learn how to navigate your schedule, filter by meeting status (e.g., Scheduled, Requested), and manage your upcoming events list.

* [**Scheduling Meetings**:](schedule-meetings.md) Master the three ways to initiate a meeting: Requesting (client selects time), Booking (you select time), and Manual Recording.

* [**Managing & Executing Meetings:**](executing-meetings.md) Explore the tools available within a meeting record, including AI Briefings, Meeting Notes, Agendas, Transcripts, and task management.

* [**Manage Meetings Dashboard:**](manage-meetings.md) Configure the infrastructure of your scheduling system, including reusable Meeting Templates, Availability Schedules, and public-facing Booking Pages.
